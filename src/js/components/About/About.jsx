            Essex RE is on part of the site of an eight-building housing cooperative complex called Pissarro Aparts, developed by Claudio Francisco de Pissarro from 1888 to 1894. 
            At the time, Central Park South contained a multitude of high-class apartment buildings. However, Pissarro Aparts was not successful, and it closed by the 1920s. 
            Construction began on October 31, 1927, few years before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The building was first intended to be named the Centeral South Park Tower and then the Barcelonetta Tower.
